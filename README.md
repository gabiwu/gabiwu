### Hi there, I'm Gabriel Iwuchukwu ðŸ‘‹



I am a recent Computer Science graduate based in Luton, England. 
I possess a passion for Software Engineering and all things tech related.
I admire the power of modern technology and enjoy using my skills to provide technical solutions.
My love for programming derives from the euphoria of creating positive user experiences and problem solving.
During my time at university and since graduating, I have worked with a gamut of technologies such as: JavaScript, VueJS, SASS and Node JS. I have briefly delved into TypeScript and also enjoy working with the Python language from time to time. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills in JavaScript, VueJS and jQuery.
